This is a small Java programm, that decomposes a number N into two prime numbers p and q using the period finding algorithm.

How to run
=================
Download and compile with javac. Precompiled .jar's might be added later.

TODO
=================
<ul>
<li>Make p=q; N=p^2 work!</li>
<li>Use BigInteger for p, q and N (so that we can factor larger N's than 32bit!)</li>
<li>Better Documentation</li>
<li>Make a nice UI</li>
</ul>
